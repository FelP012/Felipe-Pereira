                OBAT (one bit at a time) is a project created in 2023 by myself. It is a virtual platform where content about mathematics and general computer science is uploaded weekly, ideal for those students who are not satisfied with just having a teacher and for those who want to learn even more, a space of coexistence where students from all over the world can ask their questions without fear of being judged, a mathematical utopia...

                My name is Felipe Pereira as you may know from my mania for putting my name everywhere on this page, I know, a little obnoxious.So, I am a student of computer engineering at UDELAR, uruguay. I I could have access to a computer from a very early age, like at 5 years old, since then I played many old school games, like contra for example, at the age of 6 the state gave me a computer by the "one laptop per child" movement, I did everything possible to understand how the fuck could a device so small have so much capacity and features, incredible no? I still did not know what a cell phone was? Anyway, I hacked it and opened it to see its components, how each one worked, it was something wonderful that filled me with hope, what could there be in the future? well look at us now, he. It was at the age of 9 when I had the morbid curiosity to control a metal device and wires, a computer, it was then that my parents bought me my first programming book: "algorithms and programming in pascal". the rest is history...
